About Project :

In the project I have created a static Tour & Travel WEBSITE. A static website, as you may guess, doesn’t change – there is no user interactivity besides hyperlinks. It usually contains only HTML and CSS, with no server-side scripting languages. You write the code for pages individually and that code is displayed to visitors.

What does this mean?

Each page is unique and built from the ground up.Headers, footers, and so on are not universal. So, when even a small tweak is made, every single footer on every single page needs to be updated.There is no interactivity such as user commenting or accounts. Many free sit builders only let you create static websites, where you build your site page-by-page and with limited-to-no interactive elements.
